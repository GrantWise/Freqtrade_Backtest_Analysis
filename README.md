# Freqtrade_Backtest_Analysis

This is an attempt to compare the top 30 strategies being used on freqtrade. I have downloaded backtest going back to Jan 2018 using all pairs available for each timeframe that the backtests are run.
The backtests that I use all have a fixed stake amount so that I can append the backtest results.

Please feel free to make changes or suggest edits, this anaylsis is intended to both assist in understanding the differences between the strategies and to improve my python coding.
